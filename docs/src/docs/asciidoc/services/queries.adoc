GORM Data Services will implement queries for you using a number of different strategies and conventions.

It does this by looking at the return type of a method and the method stem and picking the most appropriate implementation.

The following table summarizes the conventions:

include::queryConventions.adoc[]

The conventions are extensible (more on that later), in terms of queries there are two distinct types.

==== Simple Queries

include::simpleQueries.adoc[]

==== Dynamic Finder Queries

include::finderQueries.adoc[]

==== Where Queries

include::whereQueries.adoc[]

=== Query Joins

You can specify query joins using the `@Join` annotation:

[source,groovy]
----
import static javax.persistence.criteria.JoinType.*

@Service(Book)
interface BookService {
    @Join('author')
    Book find(String title) <1>

    @Join(value='author', type=LEFT) <2>
    Book findAnother(String title)
}
----

<1> Join on the `author` property
<2> Join on the `author` property using a `LEFT OUTER` join

==== JPA-QL Queries

include::hqlQueries.adoc[]

==== Query Projections

include::queryProjections.adoc[]
