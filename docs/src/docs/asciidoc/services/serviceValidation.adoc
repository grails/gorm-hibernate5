GORM Data Services have built in support for `jakarta.validation` annotations for method parameters.

You will need to have a `jakarta.validation` implementation on your classpath (such as `hibernate-validator` and then simply annotate your method parameters using the appropriate annotation. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
import jakarta.validation.constraints.*

@Service(Book)
interface BookService {

    Book find(@NotNull String title)
}
----

In the above example the `NotNull` constraint is applied to the `title` property. If `null` is passed to the method a `ConstraintViolationException` exception will be thrown.
