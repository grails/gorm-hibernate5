If you want to hook into GORM and customize how Hibernate is configured there are a variety of ways to achieve that when using GORM.

Firstly, as mentioned previously, any configuration you specify when configuring GORM for Hibernate will be passed through to Hibernate so you can configure any setting of Hibernate itself.

For more advanced configuration you may want to configure or supply a new link:../api/org/grails/orm/hibernate/connections/HibernateConnectionSourceFactory.html[HibernateConnectionSourceFactory] instance or a link:../api/org/grails/orm/hibernate/cfg/HibernateMappingContextConfiguration.html[HibernateMappingContextConfiguration] or both.

==== The HibernateConnectionSourceFactory

The `HibernateConnectionSourceFactory` is used to create a new Hibernate `SessionFactory` on startup.

If you are using Spring, it is registered as a Spring bean using the name `hibernateConnectionSourceFactory` and therefore can be overridden.

If you are not using Spring it can be passed to the constructor of the `HibernateDatastore` class on instantiation.

The `HibernateConnectionSourceFactory` has a few useful setters that allow you to specify a Hibernate https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/javadocs/org/hibernate/Interceptor.html[Interceptor] or https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/javadocs/org/hibernate/boot/spi/MetadataContributor.html[MetadataContributor] (Hibernate 5+ only).

==== The HibernateMappingContextConfiguration

link:../api/org/grails/orm/hibernate/cfg/HibernateMappingContextConfiguration.html[HibernateMappingContextConfiguration] is built by the `HibernateConnectionSourceFactory`, but a customized version can be specified using the `hibernate.configClass` setting in your configuration:

[source,yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
hibernate:
	configClass: com.example.MyHibernateMappingContextConfiguration
----

The customized version should extend `HibernateMappingContextConfiguration` and using this class you can add additional classes, packages, `hbm.cfg.xml` files and so on.
