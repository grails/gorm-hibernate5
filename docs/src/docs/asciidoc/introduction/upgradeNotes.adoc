==== Dependency Upgrades

GORM 7.1 supports Apache Groovy 3 and Java 14 Hibernate 5.5.x and Spring 5.3.x.

Each of these underlying components may have changes that require altering your application. These changes are beyond the scope of this documentation.

==== Default Autowire By Type inside GORM Data Services

A Grails Service (or a bean) inside GORM DataService will default to autowire by-type, For example:

_./grails-app/services/example/BookService.groovy_
```
package example

import grails.gorm.services.Service

@Service(Book)
abstract class BookService {

    TestService testRepo

    abstract Book save(String title, String author)

    void doSomething() {
        assert testRepo != null
    }
}
```

Please note that with autowire by-type as the default, when multiple beans for same type are found the application with throw Exception. Use the Spring `@Qualifier annotation for https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.10/reference/html/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation-qualifiers[Fine-tuning Annotation Based Autowiring with Qualifiers].
