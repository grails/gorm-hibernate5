See the http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/whatsNew/manual[What's New in GORM 6.1] guide for more information.

==== GORM 6.0

GORM 6.0 continues to evolve the new trait based model and includes the following new features:

* Support for MongoDB 3.2.x drivers
* Support for Neo4j 3.x drivers
* Unified configuration model across all implementations
* Unified Multiple Data Sources support for Hibernate, MongoDB and Neo4j
* Multi Tenancy support for Hibernate, MongoDB and Neo4j
* RxGORM for MongoDB built on MongoDB Rx drivers
* RxGORM for REST built on RxNetty


==== GORM 5.0

GORM 5.0 replaced the majority of the custom AST transformations that power GORM with http://docs.groovy-lang.org/next/html/documentation/core-traits.html[Groovy Traits].

Support for the MongoDB 3.x drivers, Neo4j 2.3.x and Hibernate 5.x was added.

==== GORM 4.0

GORM 4.0 continued to separate the GORM API from the Grails core APIs and was the first version to be support standalone execution outside of Grails.

GORM 4.0 was released in conjunction with Grails 3.0 and also featured auto configuration starters for Spring Boot.

Support was introduced for MongoDB 2.x drivers, Neo4j 2.2.x and Hibernate 4.3.x.

==== GORM 3.0

GORM 3.0 was the first release of GORM that was released separately to the Grails framework itself and was introduced in Grails 2.1.

More of the metaprogramming functions were refactored and replaced with AST transformations and APIs introduced that allowed GORM to operate against multiple database implementations including MongoDB.

The GORM API was separated from Hibernate and an SDK and TCK released for building compatible implementations.

==== GORM 2.0

GORM 2.0 evolved as part of Grails 2.0 and re-engineered some of the metaprogramming logic that relied on ExpandoMetaClass into a set of http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html#_compile_time_metaprogramming[Groovy AST transformations].

These AST transformations relied on the Grails 2.x compiler infrastructure and hence this version of GORM was also only usable from within Grails.

==== GORM 1.0

The first version of GORM was a series of meta-programming functions that built on the capabilities of Groovy's http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html#metaprogramming_emc[ExpandoMetaClass].

It was purely dynamic and integrated into the http://grails.org[Grails framework] and not usable without Grails and hence no actual distribution exists for this version and it is only available as part of Grails.
