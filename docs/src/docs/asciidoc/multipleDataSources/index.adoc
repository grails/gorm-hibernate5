GORM supports the notion of multiple data sources where multiple individual SQL `DataSource` instances can be configured and switched between.

=== The ConnectionSources API

Introduced in GORM 6.0, the link:../api/org/grails/datastore/mapping/core/connections/ConnectionSources.html[ConnectionSources] API allows you to introspect the data sources configured for the application:

[source,groovy]
----
@Autowired
HibernateDatastore hibernateDatastore
...
ConnectionSources<SessionFactory, HibernateConnectionSourceSettings> connectionSources
					= hibernateDatastore.getConnectionSources()

for(ConnectionSource<SessionFactory, HibernateConnectionSourceSettings> connectionSource in connectionSources) {
	println "Name $connectionSource.name"
	SessionFactory sessionFactory = connectionSource.source
}
