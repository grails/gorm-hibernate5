There are various changes you have to make to your build depending on the version of Grails when using GORM {version}.

==== Grails 3.2.x and above with Hibernate 4

Grails 3.2.x is based on Spring Boot 1.4.x which enforces Hibernate 5.0.x as the default version. If you want to continue to use Hibernate 4 you must explicitly declare the Hibernate 4 dependences in `build.gradle`.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    compile "org.grails.plugins:hibernate4"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-core:4.3.10.Final"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-ehcache:4.3.10.Final"
}
----

==== Grails 3.1.x and below with Hibernate 5

Grails 3.1.x and below are based on Spring Boot 1.3.x which enforces Hibernate 4 as the default version of Hibernate, hence you have to use explicit versions to depend on Hibernate 5:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    compile "org.grails.plugins:hibernate5"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-core:5.1.0.Final"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-ehcache:5.1.0.Final"
}
----

==== Grails 3.0.x Spring Version Conflicts

Grails 3.0.x enforces Spring 4.1.x as the Spring version, so if you want to use Hibernate 5 you must force an upgrade to Spring 4.2.x in `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
// the below is unnecessary in Grails 3.1 and above, but required in Grails 3.0.x
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
            if(details.requested.group == 'org.springframework') {
                details.useVersion('4.2.3.RELEASE')
            }
        }
    }
}
----

The `resolutionStrategy` is needed to enforce an upgrade to Spring 4.2.x which is required by Hibernate 5 support. This block is not needed if you are using Grails 3.1 or above.
