When building applications you have to consider the problem domain you are trying to solve. For example if you were building an http://www.amazon.com/[Amazon]-style bookstore you would be thinking about books, authors, customers and publishers to name a few.

These are modeled in GORM as Groovy classes, so a `Book` class may have a title, a release date, an ISBN number and so on. The next few sections show how to model the domain in GORM.


Consider the following domain class:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/org/bookstore/Book.groovy
----
package org.bookstore

class Book {
}
----

This class will map automatically to a table in the database called `book` (the same name as the class).

NOTE: This behaviour is customizable through the <<ormdsl,ORM Domain Specific Language>>

Now that you have a domain class you can define its properties as Java types. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
package org.bookstore

class Book {
    String title
    Date releaseDate
    String ISBN
}
----

Each property is mapped to a column in the database, where the convention for column names is all lower case separated by underscores. For example `releaseDate` maps onto a column `release_date`. The SQL types are auto-detected from the Java types, but can be customized with <<constraints,Constraints>> or the <<ormdsl,ORM DSL>>.
