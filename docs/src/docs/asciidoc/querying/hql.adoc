GORM classes also support Hibernate's query language HQL, a very complete reference for which can be found https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#hql[in the Hibernate documentation] of the Hibernate documentation.

GORM provides a number of methods that work with HQL including link:../api/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormEntity.html#find(java.lang.String)[find], link:../api/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormEntity.html#findAll(java.lang.String)[findAll] and link:../api/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormEntity.html#executeQuery(java.lang.String)[executeQuery].

An example of a query can be seen below:

[source,java]
----
def results =
      Book.findAll("from Book as b where b.title like 'Lord of the%'")
----


==== Named Parameters


In this case the value passed to the query is hard coded, however you can equally use named parameters:

[source,java]
----
def results =
      Book.findAll("from Book as b " +
                   "where b.title like :search or b.author like :search",
                   [search: "The Shi%"])
----

[source,java]
----
def author = Author.findByName("Stephen King")
def books = Book.findAll("from Book as book where book.author = :author",
                         [author: author])
----


==== Multiline Queries

Use the triple quoted strings to separate the query across multiple lines:

[source,java]
----
def results = Book.findAll("""
from Book as b,
     Author as a
where b.author = a and a.surname = :surname""", [surname:'Smith'])
----


==== Pagination and Sorting


You can also perform pagination and sorting whilst using HQL queries. To do so simply specify the pagination options as a Map at the end of the method call and include an "ORDER BY" clause in the HQL:

[source,java]
----
def results =
      Book.findAll("from Book as b where " +
                   "b.title like 'Lord of the%' " +
                   "order by b.title asc",
                   [max: 10, offset: 20])
----
