GORM's transaction management is built on Spring and uses Spring's Transaction abstraction for dealing with programmatic transactions.

However, GORM classes have been enhanced to make this simpler with the link:../api/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormEntity.html#withTransaction(groovy.lang.Closure)[withTransaction(Closure)]  method. This method has a single parameter, a Closure, which has a single parameter which is a Spring https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionStatus.html[TransactionStatus] instance.

==== Using the withTransaction Method

Here's an example of using `withTransaction` in a controller methods:

[source,java]
----
def transferFunds() {
    Account.withTransaction { status ->
        def source = Account.get(params.from)
        def dest = Account.get(params.to)

        def amount = params.amount.toInteger()
        if (source.active) {
            if (dest.active) {
                source.balance -= amount
                dest.amount += amount
            }
            else {
                status.setRollbackOnly()
            }
        }
    }
}
----

In this example we rollback the transaction if the destination account is not active. 

Also, if an `Exception` (both checked or runtime exception) or `Error` is thrown during the process the transaction will automatically be rolled back..

WARNING: GORM versions prior to 6.0.0 did not roll back transactions for a checked `Exception`.

You can also use "save points" to rollback a transaction to a particular point in time if you don't want to rollback the entire transaction. This can be achieved through the use of Spring's https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/SavepointManager.html[SavePointManager] interface.

The `withTransaction` method deals with the begin/commit/rollback logic for you within the scope of the block.

==== Using TransactionService

Since GORM 6.1, if you need more flexibility then instead you can instead take advantage of the link:../api/grails/gorm/transactions/TransactionService.html[TransactionService], which can be obtained by looking it up from from the `HibernateDatastore`:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.gorm.transactions.*

TransactionService transactionService = datastore.getService(TransactionService)
----

Or via dependency injection:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.gorm.transactions.*

@Autowired TransactionService transactionService
----

Once you have an instance then there are various including `withTransaction`, `withRollback`, `withNewTransaction` etc. which helps with the construction of programmatic transactions.
